## Asynchronous Search

https://github.com/minad/consult#asynchronous-search

Doom Emacs uses the perl splitting style, which splits the input string at a punctuation character and treats each as an Emacs regular expression, so special characters like `$` has to be escaped.

To avoid such splitting, add a backslash (`\`) before spaces.
