> Out of the box, you can install any package listed on MELPA, GNU ELPA, or Emacsmirror, which is to say any package in existence. (Although MELPA is used as a package listing, packages are installed by cloning their Git repositories rather than by downloading tarballs like package.el does.)

Most of the time you don't need to specify a `:recipe`.
