## Do not clear the screen on exit

```
       -X or --no-init
	      Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization
	      strings to the terminal.	This is  sometimes  desirable  if  the
	      deinitialization	string does something unnecessary, like clear-
	      ing the screen.
```
