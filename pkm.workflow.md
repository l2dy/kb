## My PKM Workflow (WIP)

First, use [[pkm.org-roam]] to collect small pieces of information, following the Zettelkasten method. Tag every interesting blog I've read with topics, keep notes when reading books, and store pieces of information verbatim or slightly processed. One can always reorganize notes later, but fast capture is key to persistence.

Second, implement the [[pkm.para]] method in a cross-platform note taking system with automatic syncing. It could be org-roam with Dropbox, a specialized software for note taking, or whatever suits. It helps enabling actions, like keeping a blog and improving health conditions.

Third, reorganize. org-roam makes it very easy to reorganize notes, making it a perfect fit for a large flat knowledge base. The PARA method is also optimized for opportunistic reorganization.

Last, share the knowledge I've gained. I'd blog what I've learned in the right language, or put it in a public [[pkm.dendron]] vault, depending on how valuable this piece of knowledge is to others and how I'd like them to be found. Blogs are sufficiently polished, optimized for search engines and focused on a particular subject, while a Dendron vault stores a collection of knowledge under a hierarchy and is constantly a work in progress.
