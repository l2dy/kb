## My PKM Workflow (WIP)

First, use [[pkm.dendron]] for knowledge collection and [[pkm.logseq]] for work. Tag every interesting blog I've read with topics, keep notes when reading books, and store pieces of information verbatim or slightly processed. One can always reorganize notes later, but fast capture is key to persistence.

Second, implement the [[pkm.para]] method in a cross-platform note taking system with automatic syncing. It could be org-roam with Dropbox, a specialized software for note taking, or whatever suits. I'm choosing Notion for this, and it helps enabling actions, like keeping a blog and improving health conditions.

Third, reorganize. The PARA method is optimized for opportunistic reorganization, but reorganizing notes in Dendron is not easy, i.e. there is room for improvement.

Last, share the knowledge I've gained. I'd blog what I've learned in the right language, or put it in a public [[pkm.dendron]] vault, depending on how valuable this piece of knowledge is to others and how I'd like them to be found. Blogs are sufficiently polished, optimized for search engines and focused on a particular subject, while a Dendron vault stores a collection of knowledge under a hierarchy and is constantly a work in progress.
